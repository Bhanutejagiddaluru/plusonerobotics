# Computer Vision Project

### Plus One Robotics – Round 2

This project presents a feedforward **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**–based computer vision pipeline designed to learn hierarchical spatial representations from image data, where raw image tensors are transformed through successive convolutional and pooling layers to construct multi-level feature abstractions.

The system performs structured image preprocessing, followed by convolutional feature extraction using learnable kernels, and applies non-linear transformations to generate discriminative feature maps. These extracted representations are then utilized for model training, inference, and performance evaluation, enabling robust visual pattern recognition.
